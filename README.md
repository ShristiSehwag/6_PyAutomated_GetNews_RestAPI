API automation testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and reliability of software applications. 

APIs serve as the building blocks of software in this approach, and their quality directly impacts the applicationâ€™s overall performance. 

API automation allows for efficient validation of these APIs, ensuring they function as expected and adhere to the required standards.

Moreover, API automation becomes even more critical in an API-first development approach, where applications are built by linking several different APIs.

## Code:
Retrieves news articles related to a specific topic (in this case, 'space') from the specified date range using the News API.

### API Request:

Constructs a URL with the specified parameters to query the News API (newsapi.org).

Uses Title parameter to search for articles with the specified topic in their title.

Specifies the language of articles (language parameter).

Includes the API key for authentication (apiKey parameter).

### Output:

Prints the title and description of each news article retrieved from the API.


This code simplifies the process of fetching and displaying news articles based on specified criteria using the News API, providing a convenient way to stay updated on current events related to the topic of interest.
